            <p>BSU can be considered as a storage token that allows the owner to perform transactions on the blockchain.
                The resource allocation is within the token itself. Resources are managed by one call of a function,

                    <p>The amount of BSU is fixed in quantity on a blockchain. If someone wants to create blocks and
                        validate transactions on a blockchain, you can become a Node and earn BSU. This BSU can be
                        stored in a wallet or used to buy more resources. In order to become a node you need an account
                        and a server. For more information on how to set up your server, please visit Infrastructure.

                        validating transactions. <br>
                        Another way to get BSU is buying BSUC on an exchange in order to trade BSUC for BSU memory on
                        Uniswap.

                        well as the exchange price. The more projects are added to Inery the more BSU memory will be
